## [0.4.0]

### Added
* This CHANGELOG.

### Changed
* Updated lwIP to v2.1.3-rc1.

## [0.3.0]

### Changed
* Updated lwIP to the "real" v2.1.2 release.
* The library now works with Arduino.

### Fixed
* `EthernetUDP::endPacket()` was using `nullptr` for the pbuf.
* `EthernetUDP::beginPacket()` was not setting the output port.

## [0.2.0]

### Added
* Small delays in `EthernetClient` output functions to allow data to flush. This
  allows user programs to avoid having to call `yield()` themselves.
* Flushing the output before closing the connection in `EthernetClient::stop()`.
* Global Arduino-style `MDNS` object and a rename of the class to `MDNSClass`.
* `yield()` calls in the `EthernetClient` input functions to allow user programs
  to avoid having to call `yield()` themselves.

### Changed
* Removed all the atomic fences.
* Brought `Print::write` functions into scope for Client, Server, and UDP by
  using a `using Print::write` directive.
* New centralized connection management.

### Fixed
* Fixed `EthernetClass::begin()` return value; it was the opposite.

## [0.1.0]

### Added
* Initial release.
